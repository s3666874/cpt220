The Shadow Over Innsmouth
I

During the winter of 1927-28 officials of the Federal government made a strange 
and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient Massachusetts 
seaport of Innsmouth. The public first learned of it in February, when a vast 
series of raids and arrests occurred, followed by the deliberate burning and 
dynamiting - under suitable precautions - of an enormous number of crumbling, 
worm-eaten, and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront. 
Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a 
spasmodic war on liquor.
